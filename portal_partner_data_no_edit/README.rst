Configuration
=============

To test this module, you need to:

#. Block portal info editing for a partner:

  - Go to *Contacts* and choose the partner.
  - In the the *Sales and Purchases* tab, *Misc* section there is a field named
    *Block Portal Info Edit*. Enable or disable at your convenience.

Usage
=====

Once configured log in with that user and:

  - Go to `/my/account/`
  - If the editing is blocked, you won't be able to edit any detail or submit
    the form.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Add the `block_portal_data_edit` flag to the invite to portal popup.
- Add a text on the page highlighted (for example with info BS class), saying for those
  blocked users that they should contact the company for any modification.
