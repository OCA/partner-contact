Partner Relation
================

This module adds relations between partners. The type of relation is
configurable ; it supports symetric and asymetric relations.

For example, you will be able to define on the form view of partner A that :

* Partner A is a competitor of Partner B
  (symetric relation : B is a competitor of A)

* Partner A has been recommended by Partner C
  (asymetric relation : C recommands A)

* Partner A is the editor of Partner D
  (asymetric relation : D is the integrator of A)

The relations that you define on Partner A towards Partner B will
automatically be visible on the form view of Partner B.

Configuration
=============

You will have to create the type of relations in the menu
*Sales > Configuration > Address Book > Relations > Partner Relation Types*.

Usage
=====

To view and update relations of a partner, open its form view and go to the *Relations* tab.
