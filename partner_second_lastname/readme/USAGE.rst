To use this module, you need to:

* Edit any partner's form.
* Make sure the partner is not a company.
* Enter firstname and lastnames.

If you directly enter the full name instead of entering the other fields
separately (maybe from other form), this module will try to guess the best
match for your input and split it between firstname, lastname and second
lastname using an inverse function.

If you can, always enter it manually please. Automatic guessing could fail for
you easily in some corner cases.
