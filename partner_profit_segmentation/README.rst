============================
Customer Profit Segmentation
============================

This module automatically assigns customers to profit categories based
on profit the customers generate for the company.


Usage
=====

This module is relevant when you are doing sales management within Odoo.

Because Odoo will place your partners in a certain segment, you must define these segments.
Configuration of the profit segments is done under the Sales top menu:

    **Sales > Configuration > Customer profit segments**

Take care to add the segments without overlaps and gaps.

After invoicing, Odoo will add the ranking to the customers. The profit segment ranking can be found in the partner's Sales & Purchase tab.
