Contacts' Personal Information Page
===================================

This module was written to extend the contact management functionality.

Its only purpose is to serve as a base for other modules that add personal
information fields to **contacts that are persons**.

Installation
============

.. warning::
    **You should NOT install this module yourself**, because it does nothing by
    itself. This module should get installed automatically when you install
    other modules that actually do something useful.

Usage
=====

You can find a new page called *Personal Information* in the contact's form.
