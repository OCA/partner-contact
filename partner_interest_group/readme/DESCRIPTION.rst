Adds an Interests Group field (many2many), with configurable
categories.

I used the terminology “Interests Group” (cf
`wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_group_(disambiguation)>`__)
because it is flexible enough to accommodate various uses. It’s a way to
store information about what the partner is interested in.

For instance, the client for which we develop this module is a
federation of structures acting in social economy. A lot of their
activities is organizing events, social economy advocacy and
communication. They need a structured way to group their partners around
what topic they are interested in to improve their outreach.

More technical names could be for instance `Special interest
group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_interest_group>`__ or
`Advocacy group <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group>`__
