Configuration
=============

Configure all ID types you need in Contacts > Configuration > Partner ID
Categories. For example, we create a category 'Driver License':

| Name:
| Name of this ID type. For example, 'Driver License'

| Code:
| Code, abbreviation or acronym of this ID type. For example,
  'driver_license'

| Python validation code:
| Optional python code called to validate ID numbers of this ID type.
  This functionality can be overridden by setting ``id_no_validate`` to
  ``True`` in the context, such as:

.. code:: python

   partner.with_context(id_no_validate=True).write({
      'name': 'Bad Value',
      'category_id': self.env.ref('id_category_only_numerics').id,
   })

Usage
=====

In partner form you will see another tab called 'ID Numbers'. You can
add any IDs to this partner, defining:

| Category:
| ID type defined in configuration. For example, Driver License

| ID Number:
| The ID itself. For example, Driver License number of this person

| Issued by:
| Another partner, who issued this ID. For example, Traffic National
  Institution

| Place of Issuance:
| The place where the ID has been issued. For example the country for
  passports and visa

| Valid from:
| Issued date. For example, date when person approved his driving exam,
  21/10/2009

| Valid until:
| Expiration date. For example, date when person needs to renew his
  driver license, 21/10/2019

| Status:
| ID status. For example new/to renew/expired

| Notes:
| Any further information related with this ID. For example, vehicle
  types this person can drive

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  If you want to search a partner by ID you will use advance search
   form. You can't search by issuer, valid dates, category or notes.
