Configuration
=============

Configure all ID types you need in Contacts > Configuration > Partner ID Categories.
For example, we create a category 'Driver License':

Name:
  Name of this ID type. For example, 'Driver License'
Code:
  Code, abbreviation or acronym of this ID type. For example, 'driver_license'
Python validation code:
  Optional python code called to validate ID numbers of this ID type. This functionality can be
  overridden by setting ``id_no_validate`` to ``True`` in the context, such as:

  .. code-block:: python

     partner.with_context(id_no_validate=True).write({
        'name': 'Bad Value',
        'category_id': self.env.ref('id_category_only_numerics').id,
     })

Usage
=====

In partner form you will see another tab called 'ID Numbers'. You can add
any IDs to this partner, defining:

Category:
  ID type defined in configuration. For example, Driver License
ID Number:
  The ID itself. For example, Driver License number of this person
Issued by:
  Another partner, who issued this ID. For example, Traffic National Institution
Place of Issuance:
  The place where the ID has been issued. For example the country for passports and visa
Valid from:
  Issued date. For example, date when person approved his driving exam, 21/10/2009
Valid until:
  Expiration date. For example, date when person needs to renew his driver license, 21/10/2019
Status:
  ID status. For example new/to renew/expired
Notes:
  Any further information related with this ID. For example, vehicle types this person can drive
