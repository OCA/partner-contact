This module extends the functionality of the CRM contact deduplicator to
add permission groups that allow the matching users to use those tools,
not needing to be the sale settings manager.

   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure this module you need to:

1. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Users*.
2. Choose a user.
3. From field *Deduplicate Contacts* under *Other* in *Access Rights*
   tab choose desired permission level:

   -  *Manually* allows to run a manual deduplication process.

   -  *Automatically* allows to run an automatic deduplication process.

      .. warning::

         Automatic contact deduplication can easily lead to unwanted
         results. Better backup before choosing this option.

   -  *Without restrictions* executes chosen deduplication method with
      admin rights, to be able to update objects where the user would
      not normally have write rights, and to allow them to merge
      contacts with different email addresses.

      .. warning::

         This is an advanced feature. Make sure to train the user(s)
         before enabling this permission.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Ask your admin to give you the new rights.
2. Go to *Contacts > Tools > Deduplicate Contacts* as usual.
