To use this module, you need to:

#. Access the form view of a partner that has contacts.

To navigate from a customer or supplier to its contacts,
in the contacts and addresses tab in the form view,
in the kanban card of each contact the name of the contact is a link that when clicked on it,
shows us the information of the selected contact.

To return to the form with the data of the source contact,
you just have to retrace the path of the bread crumbs.
