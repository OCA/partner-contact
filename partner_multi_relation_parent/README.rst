===================================
Parent contact Mapping in relations
===================================

This module maps automatically creates contact relations for contact
addresss of a partner. Inversely, you can create a contact relation between a
person and another partner, and the person will automatically become a
contact address for the other partner. A person may only have one contact
relation, because a partner may only have one parent.



Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* hide/forbade the deletion of the "Is contact of" and "Has Contact" installed
  relation types
