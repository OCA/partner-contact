The field 'Contacts & Addresses' is focused on storing contact information about the company's employees and the
company it self.
This module adds a new field 'Affiliates' on the partner form and changes 'Contacts & Addresses'
to only show individuals. This new field is in contrast to 'Contacts & Addresses' focussed on
storing information about holding companies and other company structures.
