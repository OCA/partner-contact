This module adds a new tab "Affiliates" in the partner form view and modifies the purpose of the tab "Contacts & Addresses". This new tab "Affiliates" is visible only if the partner is a company.

The existing tab "Contacts & Addresses" in Odoo Vanilla is focused on storing contact information about the company's employees and the company itself.

With this module :

- The tab "Affiliates" is focused on storing information about holding companies and other company structures.

- The tab "Contacts & Addresses" only shows individuals who are linked to the company (employees or others).
