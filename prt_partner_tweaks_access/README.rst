By default Odoo has very little options to restrict access to contacts.
Mostly this can be done using "Private" contacts.

This module allows to limit access to contacts based on:

-  Contact country
-  Contact state
-  Contact tag (group)

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

-  Go to "Settings -> User" and select a user

-  Select the contacts access level for the user In the "Contact Access"
   field

If enabled specify exact contacts user has access to:

-  Allowed Partner Categories: user will have access to partners that
   have any of these categories (tags)
-  Allowed Countries: user will have access to partners from any of the
   selected countries
-  Allowed Country States: user will have access to partners from any of
   the selected country states

Important: user will have access if any of the conditions is met.

Usage
=====

This is a base module that is meant to be uses as a part of complex
solutions. You should keep in mind that partner access restriction might
lead to access limitations for the records where those partners are
used. Eg you might encounter access errors while trying to access a
Sales Order which is done for a partner you don't have access too.
Therefore you might need to implement some workarounds for such cases.
