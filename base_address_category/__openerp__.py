 res.partner.address.category
 ----------------------------

 This module is deprecated as of OpenERP 7.0, because that version
 deprecated res.partner.address, and res.partner already has multi
 category support (visible as Tags in the user interface).

 The port of this module to OpenERP 7 keeps the model definitions, but
 removes the views (for which the base views are no longer
 available). The migration process should ensure that the
 res.partner.address.category records are migrated to
 res.partner.category records.
