Partner Tag Actions
===================

This module was written to offer a way to attach and detach tags to a partner
while keeping a history of those changes. Actions may be constrained to a date
range.

The intended usage of this is for organisations wishing to use tags to manage
contacts, and requiring that those tags be automatically added or removed based
on series of pre-determined events.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to :
- Create a res.partner
- Create a partner tag action
