This module introduces a new "Municipality" field on company and partner
records, to be used as complement to all other address fields (e.g.: country,
state, zip, city, street, ...).

A municipality has a name and a code, and it is always a smaller administrative
division than a state, to which it belongs.
In no case two different municipalities with the same code can exist within the
same state.
