Live partner address synchronization through a LDAP module (inetOrgPerson).
OpenERP becomes the master of the LDAP. Each time an address is deleted,
created or updated the same is done in the ldap (a new record is pushed).
The LDAP configuration is done in the company view. There can be one different
LDAP per company. Do not forget to activate
the LDAP link in the configuration.
The used LDAP depends on the current user company.

This module does not allows bulk batching synchronisation into the LDAP and is
thus not suitable for an instant use with an existing LDAP.
In order to use it with an existing LDAP you have to alter the uid of contact
in your LDAP. The uid should be terp_ plus the OpenERP
contact id (for example terp_10).

N.B:
The module requires the python-ldap library
Unicode support --> As python ldap does not support unicode we try to decode
string if it fails we transliterate values.
Active Directory Support for Windows server 2003, try 2008 at your own risk
(AD support not tested for Version 6 of OpenERP looking for active dir test infra)
