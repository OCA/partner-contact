===================
Partner Multi Name
===================

This module was written to extend the functionality of
"partner_second_lastname" to support having a second firstname or other names
for contact partners.

In some countries, it's important to have a second first name or more than two
names for contacts.

Contact partners will need to fill at least one of the name fields (*Firstname*
or *Other Names*).

Contact partners will need to fill at least one of the name fields (*Lastname*
or *Second Lastname*).


Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Edit any partner's form.
* Make sure the partner is not a company.
* Enter firstname, other names and lastnames.
