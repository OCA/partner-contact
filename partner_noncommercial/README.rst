Known issues / Roadmap
======================

After installing this module a situation has been encountered where the new
menu's were added to the database, but not shown in the UI. This was due to
partner_left and partner_right not being filled. To solve this, use the
generic solution when the menu-system has been messed up:
  1. stop server
  2. drop parent_left and parent_right columns frm ir_ui_menu table
  3. start server while updating base module
