This module allows you to generate a QR Code with a contact information
to then transfer it to your phone.

It introduces a new button called *"Generate Contact QR Code"* to the
**Actions** section of the contacts module. This button opens a wizard
pop up that allows you to transfer the contact information directly from
your Odoo to your phone contacts.

The wizard also allows you to select which information you want from the
contact to transfer to your phone and download the QR Code afterwards if
desired.
