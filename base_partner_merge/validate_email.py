# RFC 2822 - style email validation for Python
# (c) 2012 Syrus Akbary <me@syrusakbary.com>
# Extended from (c) 2011 Noel Bush <noel@aitools.org>
# for support of mx and user check
# This code is made available to you under the GNU LGPL v3.
#
# This module provides a single method, valid_email_address(),
# which returns True or False to indicate whether a given address
# is valid according to the 'addr-spec' part of the specification
# given in RFC 2822.  Ideally, we would like to find this
# in some other library, already thoroughly tested and well-
# maintained.  The standard Python library email.utils
# contains a parse_addr() function, but it is not sufficient
# to detect many malformed addresses.
#
# This implementation aims to be faithful to the RFC, with the
# exception of a circular definition (see comments below), and
# with the omission of the pattern components marked as "obsolete".

# All we are really doing is comparing the input string to one
# gigantic regular expression.  But building that regexp, and
# ensuring its correctness, is made much easier by assembling it
# from the "tokens" defined by the RFC.  Each of these tokens is
# tested in the accompanying unit test file.
#
# The section of RFC 2822 from which each pattern component is
# derived is given in an accompanying comment.
#
# (To make things simple, every string below is given as 'raw',
# even when it's not strictly necessary.  This way we don't forget
# when it is necessary.)
