Module name
===========

This module was written to extend the functionality of Odoo to support setting
a birthdate using a date format and allow you to benefit of a clearer API and
UI.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

* Ensure that the current contents of the *birthdate* field in the
  *res.partner* model in your database are empty or in a format easily readable
  by the python function strptime_ in case you want this module to
  automatically convert those to the new format.
* Install the OCA repository `partner-contact`_.
* Update your modules list.
* Search and install this module.

Configuration
=============

No configuration is needed.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Edit or create a partner.
* Ensure it is **not** a company.
* Go to the *Personal Information* sheet.
* Set the birthdate there.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* If you have data in your *res.partner* records' *birthdate* field that cannot
  be converted to date by Pyhton's strptime_ function, those records will have
  an empty *birthdate_date* after install.
