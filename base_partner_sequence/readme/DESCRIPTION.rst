This module adds the possibility to define a sequence for
the partner's reference. This reference is then set as default
when you create a new partner, using the defined sequence.

The reference field is treated as a commercial field, i.e. it
is managed from the commercial partner and then propagated to
the partner's contacts. The field is visible on the contacts,
but it can only be modified from the commercial partner.

No references are assigned for contacts such as shipping and
invoice addresses.
