Adds an approval workflow to Partners.
The default rule requires new company Contacts to be approved
before they can be used.

The rule can be extended to new non-company contact,
but beware that may cause issues with automatically created new contacts,
such as the ones generated when processing incoming emails.

If the 'Is Company' or 'Parent' field changes then the contact is Request
for approval.

For this, the new Contact record is kept as "Archived" until it is approved.

Installation
============

This module depends on ``base_tier_validation``. You can find it at
`OCA/server-ux <https://github.com/OCA/server-ux>`_

Usage
=====

A regular user creates a new Contact and sends it for approval:

#. Create a Contact triggering at least one "Tier Definition".
   The Contact will be in Draft state and marked as Archived until approved.
#. Click on *Request Validation* button.
#. In the *Reviews* section, at the bottom of the form, inspect the pending reviews and their status.


The approver reviews Contacts to approve:

#. Navigate to the Contacts app, and select the filter "Needs my Approval"
#. Open the Contact form to approve. It will display a
   "This Records needs to be validated" banner, with "Validate" and "Reject" options.
#. The approver can change the state to "Active".
   This will automatically unarchive the record and make it available to be used.


The Approve/Reject actions do not automatically change the State.
This could be a future improvement.
