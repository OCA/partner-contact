A regular user creates a new Contact and sends it for approval:

#. Create a Contact triggering at least one "Tier Definition".
   The Contact will be in Draft state and marked as Archived until approved.
#. Click on *Request Validation* button.
#. In the *Reviews* section, at the bottom of the form, inspect the pending reviews and their status.


The approver reviews Contacts to approve:

#. Navigate to the Contacts app, and select the filter "Needs my Approval"
#. Open the Contact form to approve. It will display a
   "This Records needs to be validated" banner, with "Validate" and "Reject" options.
#. The approver can change the state to "Active".
   This will automatically unarchive the record and make it available to be used.


The Approve/Reject actions do not automatically change the State.
This could be a future improvement.
