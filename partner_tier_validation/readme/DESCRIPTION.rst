Adds an approval workflow to Partners.
The default rule sets new company Contacts to the Draft state.

The rule can be extended to new non-company contact,
but beware that may cause issues with automatically created new contacts,
such as the ones generated when processing incoming emails.

If the 'Is Company' or 'Parent' field changes then the contact is Request
for approval.
