Adds an approval workflow to Partners.
The default rule requires new company Contacts to be approved
before they can be used.

The rule can be extended to new non-company contact,
but beware that may cause issues with automatically created new contacts,
such as the ones generated when processing incoming emails.

If the 'Is Company' or 'Parent' field changes then the contact is Request
for approval.

For this, the new Contact record is kept as "Archived" until it is approved.
