This module validates and normalizes the field ``email`` in the model
``res.partner``.

As part of the normalization, email addresses are converted to lowercase.

Optionally, multiple partners can not be allowed to have the same address.
This will not work with multiple comma-separated email addresses in the field,
although validation and normalization are still supported in such cases.

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

Install python package email-validator: ``sudo pip install email-validator``.

To not allow multiple partners to have the same email address, use the
"Filter duplicate email addresses"/``partner_email_check_filter_duplicates``

To validate that email addresses are deliverable (that the hostname exists),
use the "Check deliverability of email addresses"/``partner_email_check_check_deliverability``
setting.

Usage
=====
