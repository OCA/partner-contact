This module provides a more structured way to classify partners in Odoo.
Unlike the standard Tags (res.partner.category), which allow multiple
tags per partner, this module restricts classification to one category
per partner. The selected classification is prominently displayed at the
top of the partner's form view, right beneath the partner's name.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Odoo already allows to classify partners through Tags
(``res.partner.category``). But this module is a bit more rigid: it only
allows for one Classification per Partner. And the Classification is
shown at the top of the Form View, under the partner's name.
