===========================================
Exclude some records from the deduplication
===========================================

This module extends the possibilities of the contact deduplication allowing
to filter the applicable set according to several criteria.

For now, only the filter for restricting the deduplication to only companies or
only contacts is implemented.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Sales > Tools > Deduplicate Contacts*.
#. Mark "'Is a company?' field selected", "Parent company not set" or
   "Parent company set (Contacts)" in the section 'Exclude contacts having'.
#. This criteria will be used for excluding in the deduplication the selected
   kind of records.
